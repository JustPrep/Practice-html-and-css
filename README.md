# Practice-html-and-css
If you can't do HTML or CSS then here's a practice file I made for myself but imma share with you anyways.

Commercial use is not allowed unless you use this as base code and make big changes, but if you are a small company with not many coders, then I recommend only editing the text or list parts.
and if you think I'm a professional then you are wrong. This text is not for self promotion either. THat will result in me getting mad as this was just a list of gun games i wanted to make.
